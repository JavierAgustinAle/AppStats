# AppStats

# This web app made with Angular 11 is a statistics panel where you can see stats about users, posts and the most use tags.

 (The stats shown here are fake, they are fetch from web apis).
 ## Users Component (Three main stats are shown here about our users):
        * Genders 
        * Age of our Users
        * Countries where we are present
 ## Posts Component:
        In this component we show all the posts in the app made by the users, it is possible to filter by Incident Type.
        Also, it's possible to click on a post and see more details about it, like the location where happened.
 ## Tags Component:
        Here the most use tags are shown and you can sort them by length or alphabetically.
